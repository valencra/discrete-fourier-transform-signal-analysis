Signal-Analysis-with-DFT
========================

Signal Analysis with DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) using MATLAB. The first program uses FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) to obtain 
the DFT to analyze the spectrum of the given audio file, which is then used to regenerate the signal. The second program uses FFT
again to find the DFT of a poor-quality signal to analyze the signal spectrum and decrypt an encrypted message within the signal.
