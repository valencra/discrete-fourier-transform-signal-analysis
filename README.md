Signal-Analysis-with-DFT
========================

Signal Analysis with DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) using MATLAB. The first program uses FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) to obtain 
the DFT of the given audio file to analyze its frequency spectrum, which is then used to regenerate the signal. The second program uses FFT again to find the DFT of a poor-quality signal to analyze its frequency spectrum and decrypt an encrypted message within the signal.
